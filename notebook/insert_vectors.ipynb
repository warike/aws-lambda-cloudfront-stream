Based on an event's attributes, the system dynamically dispatches to the following: HighPriorityOrderProcessor (service A), StandardOrderProcessor (service B), UpdateOrderProcessor (service C). This pattern supports loose coupling, domain-based specialization, and runtime extensibility. This allows systems to respond intelligently to changing requirements and event semantics.\n",
